abstract = {Subject motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been problematic since its introduction as a clinical imaging modality. While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a ``toolbox{\{}''{\}} of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations.},

abstract = {Purpose To assess the prevalence, severity, and cost estimates associated with motion artifacts identified on clinical MR examinations, with a focus on the neuroaxis. Methods A retrospective review of 1 randomly selected full calendar week of MR examinations (April 2014) was conducted for the detection of significant motion artifacts in examinations performed at a single institution on 3 different MR scanners. A base-case cost estimate was computed from recently available institutional data, and correlated with sequence time and severity of motion artifacts. Results A total of 192 completed clinical examinations were reviewed. Significant motion artifacts were identified on sequences in 7.5{\%} of outpatient and 29.4{\%} of inpatient and/or emergency department MR examinations. The prevalence of repeat sequences was 19.8{\%} of total MRI examinations. The base-case cost estimate yielded a potential cost to the hospital of {\$}592 per hour in lost revenue due to motion artifacts. Potential institutional average costs borne (revenue forgone) of approximately {\$}115,000 per scanner per year may affect hospitals, owing to motion artifacts (univariate sensitivity analysis suggested a lower bound of {\$}92,600, and an upper bound of {\$}139,000). Conclusions Motion artifacts represent a frequent cause of MR image degradation, particularly for inpatient and emergency department patients, resulting in substantial costs to the radiology department. Greater attention and resources should be directed toward providing practical solutions to this dilemma.},

abstract = {Imaging biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are used to quantify normal development, disease, and the effects of disease-modifying therapies. However, motion during image acquisition introduces image artifacts that, in turn, affect derived markers. A systematic effect can be problematic since factors of interest like age, disease, and treatment are often correlated with both a structural change and the amount of head motion in the scanner, confounding the ability to distinguish biology from artifact. Here we evaluate the effect of head motion during image acquisition on morphometric estimates of structures in the human brain using several popular image analysis software packages (FreeSurfer 5.3, VBM8 SPM, and FSL Siena 5.0.7). Within-session repeated T1-weighted MRIs were collected on 12 healthy volunteers while performing different motion tasks, including two still scans. We show that volume and thickness estimates of the cortical gray matter are biased by head motion with an average apparent volume loss of roughly 0.7{\%}/mm/min of subject motion. Effects vary across regions and remain significant after excluding scans that fail a rigorous quality check. In view of these results, the interpretation of reported morphometric effects of movement disorders or other conditions with increased motion tendency may need to be revisited: effects may be overestimated when not controlling for head motion. Furthermore, drug studies with hypnotic, sedative, tranquilizing, or neuromuscular-blocking substances may contain spurious "effects" of reduced atrophy or brain growth simply because they affect motion distinct from true effects of the disease or therapeutic process.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Prospective motion correction for MRI and other imaging modalities are commonly based on the assumption of affine motion, i.e., rotations, shearing, scaling and translations. In addition it often involves transformations between different reference frames, especially for applications with an external tracking device. The goal of this work is to develop a computational framework for motion correction based on homogeneous transforms. Theory and Methods: The homogeneous representation of affine transformations uses 4 $\backslash$times 4 transformation matrices applied to four-dimensional augmented vectors. It is demonstrated how homogenous transforms can be used to describe the motion of slice objects during an MRI scan. Furthermore, we extend the concept of homogeneous transforms to gradient and k-space vectors, and show that the fourth dimension of an augmented k-space vector encodes the complex phase of the corresponding signal sample due to translations. Results: The validity of describing motion tracking in real space and k-space using homogeneous transformations only is demonstrated on phantom experiments. Conclusion: Homogeneous transformations allows for a conceptually simple, consistent and computationally efficient theoretical framework for motion correction applications.

	abstract = {Image processing was used as a fundamental tool to derive motion information from magnetic resonance (MR) images, which was fed back into prospective respiratory motion correction during subsequent data acquisition to improve image quality in coronary MR angiography (CMRA) scans. This reduces motion artifacts in the images and, in addition, enables the usage of a broader gating window than commonly used today to increase the scan efficiency. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to find a suitable motion model to be used for respiratory motion correction in cardiac imaging and to develop a calibration procedure to adapt the motion model to the individual patient. At first, the performance of three motion models [one-dimensional translation in feet-head (FH) direction, three-dimensional (3-D) translation, and 3-D affine transformation] was tested in a small volunteer study. An elastic image registration algorithm was applied to 3-D MR images of the coronary vessels obtained at different respiratory levels. A strong intersubject variability was observed. The 3-D translation and affine transformation model were found to be superior over the conventional FH translation model used today. Furthermore, a new approach is presented, which utilizes a fast model-based image registration to extract motion information from time series of low-resolution 3-D MR images, which reflects the respiratory motion of the heart. The registration is based on a selectable global 3-D motion model (translation, rigid, or affine transformation). All 3-D MR images were registered with respect to end expiration. The resulting time series of model parameters were analyzed in combination with additionally acquired motion information from a diaphragmatic MR pencil-beam navigator to calibrate the respiratory motion model. To demonstrate the potential of a calibrated motion model for prospective motion correction in coronary imaging, the approach was tested in CMRA examinations in five volunteers.},

An approach is presented that models, and removes, movement-related artifacts from fMRI time-series. This approach is predicated on the observation that movement-related effects are extant even after perfect realignment. Movement-related effects can be divided into those that are a function of position of the object in the frame of reference of the scanner and those that are due to movement in previous scans. This second component depends on the history of excitation experienced by spins in a small volume and consequent differences in local saturation. The spin excitation history thus will itself be a function of previous positions, suggesting an autoregression-moving average model for the effects of previous displacements on the current signal. A model is described as well as the adjustments for movement-related components that ensue. The empirical analyses suggest that (in extreme situations) over 90{\%} of fMRI signal can be attributed to movement, and that this artifactual component can be successfully removed.},

The algorithm determines the steady-state distribution of all voxels in a given slice and indicates which voxels need a spin-history correction. The spin-history correction is meant to be applied before standard realignment procedures. To obtain experimental data a special phantom and an MRI compatible motion system were designed. The effect of motion on spin-history is presented for data obtained using this phantom inside a 1.5-T MRI scanner. We show that the presented algorithm is capable of detecting the occurrence of a displacement, and it determines which voxels need a spin-history correction.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Robust motion correction is necessary to minimize respiratory motion artefacts in coronary MR angiography (CMRA). The state-of-the-art method uses a 1D feet-head translational motion correction approach, and data acquisition is limited to a small window in the respiratory cycle, which prolongs the scan by a factor of 2-3. The purpose of this work was to implement 3D affine motion correction for Cartesian whole-heart CMRA using a 3D navigator (3D-NAV) to allow for data acquisition throughout the whole respiratory cycle. METHODS: 3D affine transformations for different respiratory states (bins) were estimated by using 3D-NAV image acquisitions which were acquired during the startup profiles of a steady-state free precession sequence. The calculated 3D affine transformations were applied to the corresponding high-resolution Cartesian image acquisition which had been similarly binned, to correct for respiratory motion between bins. RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed no statistical difference between images acquired with the proposed method and the reference method using a diaphragmatic navigator with a narrow gating window. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that 3D-NAV and 3D affine correction can be used to acquire Cartesian whole-heart 3D coronary artery images with 100{\%} scan efficiency with similar image quality as with the state-of-the-art gated and corrected method with approximately 50{\%} scan efficiency.

The best 3D trajectory depends on tolerable scan time, readout time, geometric flexibility, flow/motion properties and others. A formalism for flow/motion sensitivity comparison based on the velocity k-space behavior is presented. It consists in finding the velocity k-space position as a function of the spatial k-space position. The trajectories are compared graphically by their velocity k-space maps, with simulations and with an objective computed index. The flow/motion properties of various 3D trajectories (cones, spiral-pr hybrid, spherical stack of spirals, 3DFT, 3D echo-planar, and shells) were determined. In terms of flow/motion sensitivity the cones trajectory is the best, however, it is difficult to use it for anisotropic resolutions or fields of view. Tolerating more flow sensitivity, the stack of spirals trajectory offers more geometric flexibility.},

A set of algorithms that can reverse the effects of object displacements and phase shifts was used. These algorithms essentially transfer the frame of reference of the image reconstruction from the static frame of the imager couch to the moving "visceral frame." An accurate record of tissue motion during image acquisition is required. To achieve this, the authors used specially encoded "navigator" echoes that are interleaved with the imaging sequence. Postprocessing of the navigator echo data provides a highly detailed record of the displacements and phase shifts that occur during imaging. Phantom studies demonstrated that the technique can directly correct image degradation caused by motion. In contrast to conventional artifact reduction techniques, such as ordered phase encoding and gradient moment nulling, this new method has a unique capacity to reduce motion unsharpness. Preliminary in vivo studies have demonstrated that the technique can markedly improve images degraded by voluntary motion and shows promise for addressing the problem of respiratory motion in thoracoabdominal imaging.},

MRI pulse sequences were developed to study k-space sampling strategies on such a shell. Data collected with a computer-controlled motion phantom with known rotational and translational motions were used to evaluate the technique. The accuracy and precision of the technique depend on the sampling density. Roughly 2000 sample points were necessary for accurate detection to within the error limits of the motion phantom when using a prototype time-intensive sampling method. This number of samples can be captured in an approximately 27-ms double excitation SNAV pulse sequence with a 3D helical spiral trajectory. Preliminary results with the helical SNAV are encouraging and indicate that accurate motion measurement suitable for retrospective or prospective correction should be feasible with SNAV echoes.},

Methods The pre-rotated, template matching SNAV method (preRot-SNAV) was developed in combination with a novel hybrid baseline strategy, which includes acquired and interpolated templates. Specifically, the SNAV templates are only rotated around X- and Y-axis; for each rotated SNAV, simulated baseline templates that mimic object rotation about the Z-axis were interpolated. The new method was first evaluated with phantom experiments. Then, a customized SNAV-interleaved gradient echo sequence was used to image three volunteers performing directed head motion. The SNAV motion measurements were used to retrospectively correct the brain images. Experiments were performed using a 3.0??T whole-body MRI scanner and both single and 8-channel head coils. Results Phantom rotations and translations measured using the hybrid baselines agreed to within 0.9?? and 1??mm compared to those measured with the original preRot-SNAV method. Retrospective motion correction of in vivo images using the hybrid preRot-SNAV effectively corrected for head rotation up to 4?? and 4??mm. Conclusions The presented hybrid approach enables the acquisition of pre-rotated baseline templates in as little as 2.5??s, and results in accurate measurement of rotations and translations.

The quality of the high-resolution structural data used for morphometric analysis is especially compromised by subject movement because high-resolution scans are of longer duration. A method is presented that measures and corrects rigid body motion and associated first-order shim changes in real time, using a pulse sequence with embedded cloverleaf navigators and a feedback control mechanism. The procedure requires a 12-s preliminary mapping scan. A single-path, 4.2-ms cloverleaf navigator is inserted every repetition time (TR) after the readout of a 3D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence, requiring no additional RF pulses and minimally impacting scan duration. Every TR, a rigid body motion estimate is made and a correction is fed back to adjust the gradients and shim offsets. Images are corrected and reconstructed on the scanner computer for immediate access. Correction for between-scan motion can be accomplished by using the same reference map for each scan repetition. Human and phantom tests demonstrated a consistent improvement in image quality if motion occurred during the acquisition.},

	abstract = {Artifacts caused by patient motion during scanning remain a serious problem in most MRI applications. The prospective motion correction technique attempts to address this problem at its source by keeping the measurement coordinate system fixed with respect to the patient throughout the entire scan process. In this study, a new image-based approach for prospective motion correction is described, which utilizes three orthogonal two-dimensional spiral navigator acquisitions, along with a flexible image-based tracking method based on the extended Kalman filter algorithm for online motion measurement. The spiral navigator/extended Kalman filter framework offers the advantages of image-domain tracking within patient-specific regions-of-interest and reduced sensitivity to off-resonance-induced corruption of rigid-body motion estimates. The performance of the method was tested using offline computer simulations and online in vivo head motion experiments. In vivo validation results covering a broad range of staged head motions indicate a steady-state error of less than 10{\%} of the motion magnitude, even for large compound motions that included rotations over 15 deg. A preliminary in vivo application in three-dimensional inversion recovery spoiled gradient echo (IR-SPGR) and three-dimensional fast spin echo (FSE) sequences demonstrates the effectiveness of the spiral navigator/extended Kalman filter framework for correcting three-dimensional rigid-body head motion artifacts prospectively in high-resolution three-dimensional MRI scans.},

This time fits well into the existing gaps in sequences routinely used for neuroimaging, thus giving a motion-corrected sequence with no extra time required. We also demonstrate motion-driven selective reacquisition of k-space to further compensate for subject motion. We perform multiple validation experiments to evaluate accuracy, navigator impact on tissue intensity/contrast, and the improvement in final output. The complete system operates without adding additional hardware to the scanner and requires no external calibration, making it suitable for high-throughput environments.},

	abstract = {PROPELLER MRI (periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction) provides images with significantly fewer B0-related artifacts than echo-planar imaging (EPI), as well as reduced sensitivity to motion compared to conventional multiple-shot fast spin-echo (FSE). However, the minimum imaging time in PROPELLER is markedly longer than in EPI and 50{\%} longer than in conventional multiple-shot FSE. Often in MRI, imaging time is reduced by undersampling k-space. In the present study, the effects of undersampling on PROPELLER images were evaluated using simulated and in vivo data sets. Undersampling using PROPELLER patterns with reduced number of samples per line, number of lines per blade, or number of blades per acquisition, while maintaining the same k-space field of view (FOVk) and uniform sampling at the edges of FOVk, reduced imaging time but led to severe image artifacts. In contrast, undersampling by means of removing whole blades from a PROPELLER sampling pattern that sufficiently samples k-space produced only minimal image artifacts, mainly manifested as blurring in directions parallel to the blades removed, even when reducing imaging time by as much as 50{\%}. Finally, undersampling using asymmetric blades and taking advantage of Hermitian symmetries to fill-in the missing data significantly reduced imaging time without causing image artifacts.},

	abstract = {Split-blade diffusion-weighted periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (DW-PROPELLER) was proposed to address the issues associated with diffusion-weighted echo planar imaging such as geometric distortion and difficulty in high-resolution imaging. The major drawbacks with DW-PROPELLER are its high SAR (especially at 3T) and violation of the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill condition, which leads to a long scan time and narrow blade. Parallel imaging can reduce scan time and increase blade width; however, it is very challenging to apply standard k-space-based techniques such as GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) to split-blade DW-PROPELLER due to its narrow blade. In this work, a new calibration scheme is proposed for k-space-based parallel imaging method without the need of additional calibration data, which results in a wider, more stable blade. The in vivo results show that this technique is very promising. Magn Reson Med, 2011. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. },

	abstract = {The k-space readout of propeller-type sequences may be accelerated by the use of parallel imaging (PI). For PROPELLER, the main benefits are reduced blurring due to T2 decay and specific absorption ratio (SAR) reduction, whereas, for EPI-based propeller acquisitions, such as Turbo-PROP and short-axis readout propeller EPI (SAP-EPI), the faster k-space traversal alleviates geometric distortions. In this work, the feasibility of calculating a two-dimensional (2D) GRAPPA kernel on only the undersampled propeller blades themselves is explored, using the matching orthogonal undersampled blade. It is shown that the GRAPPA kernel varies slowly across blades; therefore, an angularly continuous 2D GRAPPA kernel is proposed, in which the angular variation of the weights is parameterized. This new angularly continuous kernel formulation greatly increases the numerical stability of the GRAPPA weight estimation, allowing for generation of fully sampled diagnostic quality images using only the undersampled propeller data.

	abstract = {A technique integrating multishot periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) and parallel imaging is presented for diffusion echo-planar imaging (EPI) at high spatial resolution. The method combines the advantages of parallel imaging to achieve accelerated sampling along the phase-encoding direction, and PROPELLER acquisition to further decrease the echo train length (ETL) in EPI. With an eight-element circularly symmetric RF coil, a parallel acceleration factor of 4 was applied such that, when combined with PROPELLER acquisition, a reduction of geometric distortions by a factor substantially greater than 4 was achieved. The resulting phantom and human brain images acquired with a 256 × 256 matrix and an ETL of only 16 were visually identical in shape to those acquired using the fast spin-echo (FSE) technique, even without field-map corrections. It is concluded that parallel PROPELLER-EPI is an effective technique that can substantially reduce susceptibility-induced geometric distortions at high field strength.

	abstract = {A fat-saturated twice-refocused spin echo sequence was implemented on a GE Signa 1.5-T whole-body system for diffusion-weighted imaging. Data were acquired using an analytically designed interleaved variable-density (VD) spiral readout trajectory. This flexible design algorithm allowed real-time prescription on the scanner. Each interleaf of the VD spiral oversampled the center of k-space. The oversampling provided an inherent motion compensation capability. The resultant diffusion-weighted images showed good quality without any retrospective motion correction. An iterated motion correction algorithm was developed to further reduce the signal cancellation artifact caused by motion-induced phase error. In this algorithm, a low-resolution phase map was estimated using the oversampled data in the center of k-space in order to correct for phase error in image space. In vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies were performed on the brains of healthy volunteers. High-quality isotropic diffusion-weighted images, trace maps, and FA maps from axial, sagittal, and coronal slices were obtained using a VD spiral readout trajectory with matrix size 256 x 256. To our knowledge, this was also the first time in vivo 512 x 512 DTI results were reported.},

	abstract = {Phase-navigated multi-shot acquisition and parallel imaging are two techniques that have been applied to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to diminish distortions and to enhance spatial resolution. Specifically, sensitivity encoding (SENSE) has been combined with single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI). Thus far, it has been difficult to apply parallel imaging methods, like SENSE, to multi-shot DWI because motion-induced phase error varies from shot to shot and interferes with sensitivity encoding. Although direct phase subtraction methods have been introduced to correct this phase error, they generally are not suitable for SENSE reconstruction, and they cannot remove all the motion artifacts even if the phase error is fully known. Here, an effective algorithm is proposed to correct the motion-induced phase error using an iterative reconstruction. In this proposed conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm, the phase error is treated as an image encoding function. Given the complex perturbation terms, diffusion-weighted images can be reconstructed using an augmented sensitivity map. The mathematical formulation and image reconstruction procedures of this algorithm are similar to the SENSE reconstruction. By defining a dynamic composite sensitivity, the CG phase correction method can be conveniently incorporated with SENSE reconstruction for the application of multi-shot SENSE DWI. Effective phase correction and multi-shot SENSE DWI (R = 1 to 3) are demonstrated on both simulated and in vivo data acquired with PROPELLER and SNAILS.},

While the translational motion artifact can be easily removed from the radial trajectory data by phase correction, correction of rotational motion still remains a challenge in radial MRI. We present a novel method to refocus the image corrupted by view-to-view motion in the view-interleaved radial MRI data. In this method, the error in rotational view angles was modeled as a polynomial function of the view order and the model parameters were estimated by minimizing the self-navigator image metrics such as image entropy, gradient entropy, normalized gradient squared and mean square difference. Translational motion correction was conducted by aligning the projection profiles. Simulation studies were conducted to demonstrate the robustness of both translational and rotational motion correction methods in different noise levels. The proposed method was successfully applied to correct for motion of healthy subjects. Substantial motion correction with relative error of less than 5{\%} was achieved by using either first- or second-order model with the image metrics. This study demonstrates the potential of the method for motion-sensitive applications. ?? 2008.},

	abstract = {Interest in radial MRI (also known as projection reconstruction (PR) MRI) has increased recently for uses such as fast scanning and undersampled acquisitions. Additionally, PR acquisitions offer intrinsic advantages over standard two-dimensional Fourier transform (2DFT) imaging with respect to motion of the imaged object. It is well known that aligning each spatial domain projection's center of mass (calculated using the 0th and 1st moments) to the center of the field of view (FOV) corrects shifts caused by in-plane translation. In this work, a previously unrealized ability to determine the in-plane rotational motion of an imaged object using the 2nd moments of the spatial domain projections in conjunction with a specific projection angle acquisition time order is reported. We performed the correction using only the PR data itself acquired with the newly proposed projection angle acquisition time order. With the proposed view angle acquisition order, the acquisition is “self-navigating” with respect to both in-plane translation and rotation. We reconstructed the images using the aligned projections and detected acquisition angles to significantly reduce image artifacts due to such motion. The theory of the correction technique is described, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in phantom and in vivo experiments.

This is especially true for 3D imaging, where scan durations are prolonged and the assumptions of most state-of-the-art 2D rigid body motion compensation techniques break down. This paper introduces a novel motion correction technique that is capable of restoring image quality in motion corrupted 2D/3D radial acquisitions. First, the available set of projections is subdivided into motion-free subsets of data using a novel center of mass based motion detection approach. For acquisitions with multiple receiver coils, both rotational and translational motion are detected. Next, the motion parameters are estimated on a sub-pixel level by co-registration of the data subsets. This approach does not require any additional navigators or external motion estimation schemes. The capabilities and limitations of the method are described and demonstrated on an application in cranial imaging.},

This work describes Multiple Overlapping k-space Junctions for Investigating Translating Objects (MOJITO), a correction scheme based on phase differences at trajectory intersections caused by 2-D alterations in the position of an object during MR imaging. The algorithm allows both detection and correction of motion artifacts caused by 2-D rigid body translational motion. Although similar in concept to navigator echoes, MOJITO does not require a repeating path through k-space, uses k-space data from a broader region of k -space, and uses the repeated data in image reconstruction; this provides the potential for a highly efficient self-navigating motion correction method. Here, the concept and theoretical basis of MOJITO is demonstrated using the continuous sampling BOWTIE trajectory in simulation and MR experiments. This particular trajectory is selected since it is well suited for such an algorithm due to numerous trajectory intersections. Specifically, the validity of the technique in the presence of noise and off-resonance effects is demonstrated through simulation.},

	abstract = {We propose a method to compensate for six degree-of-freedom rigid motion in helical CT of the head. The method is demonstrated in simulations and in helical scans performed on a 16-slice CT scanner. Scans of a Hoffman brain phantom were acquired while an optical motion tracking system recorded the motion of the bed and the phantom. Motion correction was performed by restoring projection consistency using data from the motion tracking system, and reconstructing with an iterative fully 3D algorithm. Motion correction accuracy was evaluated by comparing reconstructed images with a stationary reference scan. We also investigated the effects on accuracy of tracker sampling rate, measurement jitter, interpolation of tracker measurements, and the synchronization of motion data and CT projections. After optimization of these aspects, motion corrected images corresponded remarkably closely to images of the stationary phantom with correlation and similarity coefficients both above 0.9. We performed a simulation study using volunteer head motion and found similarly that our method is capable of compensating effectively for realistic human head movements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical demonstration of generalized rigid motion correction in helical CT. Its clinical value, which we have yet to explore, may be significant. For example it could reduce the necessity for repeat scans and resource-intensive anesthetic and sedation procedures in patient groups prone to motion, such as young children. It is not only applicable to dedicated CT imaging, but also to hybrid PET/CT and SPECT/CT, where it could also ensure an accurate CT image for lesion localization and attenuation correction of the functional image data. {\textcopyright} 2015 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.},

	abstract = {A method is described to monitor the motion of the head during neurological positron emission tomography (PET) acquisitions and to correct the data post acquisition for the recorded motion prior to image reconstruction. The technique uses an optical tracking system, Polaris™, to accurately monitor the position of the head during the PET acquisition. The PET data are acquired in list mode where the events are written directly to disk during acquisition. The motion tracking information is aligned to the PET data using a sequence of pseudo-random numbers, which are inserted into the time tags in the list mode event stream through the gating input interface on the tomograph. The position of the head is monitored during the transmission acquisition, and it is assumed that there is minimal head motion during this measurement. Each event, prompt and delayed, in the list mode event stream is corrected for motion and transformed into the transmission space. For a given line of response, normalization, including corrections for detector efficiency, geometry and crystal interference and dead time are applied prior to motion correction and rebinning in the sinogram. A series of phantom experiments were performed to confirm the accuracy of the method: (a) a point source located in three discrete axial positions in the tomograph field of view, 0 mm, 10 mm and 20 mm from a reference point, (b) a multi-line source phantom rotated in both discrete and gradual rotations through ±5° and ±15°, including a vertical and horizontal movement in the plane. For both phantom experiments images were reconstructed for both the fixed and motion corrected data. Measurements for resolution, full width at half maximum (FWHM) and full width at tenth maximum (FWTM), were calculated from these images and a comparison made between the fixed and motion corrected datasets. From the point source measurements, the FWHM at each axial position was 7.1 mm in the horizontal direction, and increasing from 4.7 mm at the 0 mm position, to 4.8 mm, 20 mm offset, in the vertical direction. The results from the multi-line source phantom with ±5° rotations showed a maximum degradation in FWHM, when compared with the stationary phantom, of 0.6 mm, in the horizontal direction, and 0.3 mm in the vertical direction. The corresponding values for the larger rotation, ±15°, were 0.7 mm and 1.1 mm, respectively. The performance of the method was confirmed with a Hoffman brain phantom moved continuously, and a clinical acquisition using [11C]raclopride (normal volunteer. A visual comparison of both the motion and non-motion corrected images of the Hoffman brain phantom clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the method. A sample time-activity curve extracted from the clinical study showed irregularities prior to motion correction, which were removed after correction. A method has been developed to accurately monitor the motion of the head during a neurological PET acquisition, and correct for this motion prior to image reconstruction. The method has been demonstrated to be accurate and does not add significantly to either the acquisition or the subsequent data processing.},

	abstract = {Coregistration is essential for correcting head motion artifacts in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Coregistration algorithms typically realign images through optimization of a similarity measure based on voxel signal intensities. However, coregistration can also be performed through external monitoring, whereby a tracking device measures head motion directly and independently of the imaging data. This paper describes development of external monitoring using fMRI-compatible infrared cameras. Three subjects participated in block-design fMRI experiments consisting of bilateral finger tapping alone and tapping combined with visuomotor tracking to produce controlled task-correlated head motion. Functional MRI time-series were coregistered using the external monitoring technique and a known image-based algorithm for comparison. Over various performance characteristics, external monitoring and image-based coregistration exhibited good agreement, in particular reducing signals correlated with millimeter task-correlated motions by 50-100{\%}, with a 5{\%} difference between the two techniques. These results promise future applications and refinements of external monitoring in patient populations where head motion is especially problematic. Possibilities include 3D prospective coregistration during real-time fMRI, coregistration of individual slices, and motion correction in anatomic MRI.},

The performance of the available tracking hardware and its connection to the MR imager is analyzed in detail. With the introduction of a novel calibration procedure the accuracy of motion correction is improved compared to previous approaches. Together with the high geometry update rate even freely moving objects can be imaged without motion related artefacts.

	abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Subject motion appears to be a limiting factor in numerous magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) applications. In particular, head tremor, which often accompanies stroke, may render certain high-resolution two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) techniques inapplicable. The reason for that is head movement during acquisition. The study objective is to achieve a method able to compensate for complete motion during data acquisition. The method should be usable for every sequence and easily implemented on different MR scanners. Materials and Methods The possibility of interfacing the MR scanner with an external optical motion-tracking system capable of determining the object's position with submillimeter accuracy and an update rate of 60 Hz is shown. Movement information on the object position (head) is used to compensate for motion in real time by updating the field of view (FOV) by recalculating the gradients and radiofrequency parameter of the MR scanner during acquisition of k-space data, based on tracking data. Results Results of rotation phantom, in vivo experiments, and implementation of three different MRI sequences, 2D spin echo, 3D gradient echo, and echo planar imaging, are presented. Finally, the proposed method is compared with the prospective motion correction software available on the scanner software. Conclusion A prospective motion correction method that works in real time only by updating the FOV of the MR scanner is presented. Results show the feasibility of using an external optical motion-tracking system to compensate for strong and fast subject motion during acquisition.},

Corrected and uncorrected in vivo MR volumes are acquired interleaved using a modified 3D FLASH sequence, and their image quality is assessed and compared. RESULTS: The latency between motion and correction of the slice position was measured to be (19 +/- 5) ms, and the tracking noise has a standard deviation no greater than 10 mum/0.005 degrees during conventional MR scanning. Prospective motion correction improved the edge strength by 16 {\{}{\%}{\}} on average, even though the volunteers were asked to remain motionless during the acquisitions. CONCLUSION: Using a novel method for validating the effectiveness of in vivo prospective motion correction, we have demonstrated that prospective motion correction using motion data from the embedded tracking system considerably improved image quality.},

	abstract = {The tracking and compensation of patient motion during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition is an unsolved problem. For brain MRI, a promising approach recently suggested is to track the patient using an in-bore camera and a checkerboard marker attached to the patient's forehead. However, the possible tracking range of the head pose is limited by the fact that the locally attached marker must be entirely visible inside the camera's narrow field of view (FOV). To overcome this shortcoming, we developed a novel self-encoded marker where each feature on the pattern is augmented with a 2-D barcode. Hence, the marker can be tracked even if it is not completely visible in the camera image. Furthermore, it offers considerable advantages over the checkerboard marker in terms of processing speed, since it makes the correspondence search of feature points and marker-model coordinates, which are required for the pose estimation, redundant. The motion correction with the novel self-encoded marker recovered a rotation of 18?? around the principal axis of the cylindrical phantom in-between two scans. After rigid registration of the resulting volumes, we measured a maximal error of 0.39 mm and 0.15?? in translation and rotation, respectively. In in vivo experiments, the motion compensated images in scans with large motion during data acquisition indicate a correlation of 0.982 compared to a corresponding motion-free reference. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used method for non-invasive study of the structure and function of the human brain. Increasing magnetic field strengths enable higher resolution imaging; however, long scan times and high motion sensitivity mean that image quality is often limited by the involuntary motion of the subject. Prospective motion correction is a technique that addresses this problem by tracking head motion and continuously updating the imaging pulse sequence, locking the imaging volume position and orientation relative to the moving brain. The accuracy and precision of current MR-compatible tracking systems and navigator methods allows the quantification and correction of large-scale motion, but not the correction of very small involuntary movements in six degrees of freedom. In this work, we present an MR-compatible tracking system comprising a single camera and a single 15 mm marker that provides tracking precision in the order of 10mand 0.01 degrees. We show preliminary results, which indicate that when used for prospective motion correction, the system enables improvement in image quality at both 3 T and 7 T, even in experienced and cooperative subjects trained to remain motionless during imaging. We also report direct observation and quantification of the mechanical ballistocardiogram (BCG) during simultaneous MR imaging.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to compare the accuracy of two real-time motion tracking systems in the MR environment: MR-based prospective motion correction (PROMO) and optical moir{\'{e}} phase tracking (MPT). METHODS: Five subjects performed eight predefined head rotations of 8° ± 3° while being simultaneously tracked with PROMO and MPT. Structural images acquired immediately before and after each tracking experiment were realigned with SPM8 to provide a reference measurement. RESULTS: Mean signed errors (MSEs) in MPT tracking relative to SPM8 were less than 0.3 mm and 0.2° in all 6 degrees of freedom, and MSEs in PROMO tracking ranged up to 0.2 mm and 0.3°. MPT and PROMO significantly differed from SPM8 in y-translation and y-rotation values (P {\textless} 0.05). Maximum absolute errors ranged up to 2.8 mm and 2.1° for MPT, and 2.2 mm and 2.9° for PROMO. CONCLUSION: This study presents the first in vivo comparison of MPT and PROMO tracking. Our data show that two methods yielded similar performances (within 1 mm and 1° standard deviation) relative to reference image registration. Tracking errors of both systems were larger than offline tests. Future work is required for further comparison of two methods in vivo with higher precision.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Prospective motion correction of MRI scans using an external tracking device (such as a camera) is becoming increasingly popular, especially for imaging of the head. In order for external tracking data to be transformed into the MR scanner reference frame, the pose (i.e., position and orientation) of the camera relative to the scanner--or cross-calibration--must be accurate. In this study, we investigated how errors in cross-calibration affect the accuracy of motion correction feedback in MRI.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTHEORY AND METHODS: An operator equation is derived describing how calibration errors relate to errors in applied motion compensation. By taking advantage of spherical symmetry and performing a Taylor approximation for small rotation angles, a closed form expression and upper limit for the residual tracking error is provided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Experiments confirmed theoretical predictions of a bilinear dependence of the residual rotational component on the calibration error and the motion performed, modulated by a sinusoidal dependence on the angle between the calibration error axis and motion axis. The residual translation error is bounded by the sum of the rotation angle multiplied by the translational calibration error plus the linear head displacement multiplied by the calibration error angle.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The results make it possible to calculate the required cross-calibration accuracy for external tracking devices for a range of motions. Scans with smaller expected movements require less accuracy in cross-calibration than scans involving larger movements. Typical clinical applications require that the calibration accuracy is substantially below 1 mm and 1°.},

	abstract = {Utilization of external motion tracking devices is an emerging technology in head motion correction for MRI. However, cross-calibration between the reference frames of the external tracking device and the MRI scanner can be tedious and remains a challenge in practical applications. In this study, we present two hybrid methods, both of which combine prospective, optical-based motion correction with retrospective entropy-based autofocusing to remove residual motion artifacts. Our results revealed that in the presence of cross-calibration errors between the optical tracking device and the MR scanner, application of retrospective correction on prospectively corrected data significantly improves image quality. As a result of this hybrid prospective and retrospective motion correction approach, the requirement for a high-quality calibration scan can be significantly relaxed, even to the extent that it is possible to perform external prospective motion tracking without any prior cross-calibration step if a crude approximation of cross-calibration matrix exists. Moreover, the motion tracking system, which is used to reduce the dimensionality of the autofocusing problem, benefits the retrospective approach at the same time.},

	abstract = {Motion correction in magnetic resonance imaging by real-time adjustment of the imaging pulse sequence was first proposed more than 20 years ago. Recent advances have resulted from combining real-time correction with new navigator and external tracking mechanisms capable of quantifying rigid-body motion in all 6 degrees of freedom. The technique is now often referred to as "prospective motion correction." This article describes the fundamentals of prospective motion correction and reviews the latest developments in its application to brain imaging and spectroscopy. Although emphasis is placed on the brain as the organ of interest, the same principles apply whenever the imaged object can be approximated as a rigid body. Prospective motion correction can be used with most MR sequences, so it has potential to make a large impact in clinical routine. To maximize the benefits obtained from the technique, there are, however, several challenges still to be met. These include practical implementation issues, such as obtaining tracking data with minimal delay, and more fundamental problems, such as the magnetic field distortions caused by a moving object. This review discusses these challenges and summarizes the state of the art. We hope that this work will motivate further developments in prospective motion correction and help the technique to reach its full potential.},

A modified PMC system is introduced to mitigate these problems and increase the robustness of motion correction.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The method relies on simultaneously tracking two markers, each providing six degrees of freedom, that are placed on the forehead. This allows us to track head motion when one marker is obscured and detect skin movements to prevent false corrections.

	abstract = {The correction of motion artifacts continues to be a significant problem in MRI. In the case of uncooperative patients, such as children, or patients who are unable to remain stationary, the accurate determination and correction of motion artifacts becomes a very important prerequisite for achieving good image quality. The application of conventional motion-correction strategies often produces inconsistencies in k-space data. As a result, significant residual artifacts can persist. In this work a formalism is introduced for parallel imaging in the presence of motion. The proposed method can improve overall image quality because it diminishes k-space inconsistencies by exploiting the complementary image encoding capacity of individual receiver coils. Specifically, an augmented version of an iterative SENSE reconstruction is used as a means of synthesizing the missing data in k-space. Motion is determined from low-resolution navigator images that are coregistered by an automatic registration routine. Navigator data can be derived from self-navigating k-space trajectories or in combination with other navigation schemes that estimate patient motion. This correction method is demonstrated by interleaved spiral images collected from volunteers. Conventional spiral scans and scans corrected with proposed techniques are shown, and the results illustrate the capacity of this new correction approach. Keywords},

Each 1D regridding, expressed in matrix form, requires a matrix inversion to gain an exact solution. Undersampled regions make the matrix ill-conditioned but summing the matrix columns (without inversion) indicates the undersampled regions. The missing data could be reacquired, but in this study it is estimated using a Delaunay triangle-based linear interpolation on the original 2D data. The matrix conditioning is improved, leading to images with reduced artifacts compared to other regridding schemes.

	abstract = {Motion of an object degrades MR images, as the acquisition is time-dependent, and thus k-space is inconsistently sampled. This causes ghosts. Current motion correction methods make restrictive assumptions on the type of motions, for example, that it is a translation or rotation, and use special properties of k-space for these transformations. Such methods, however, cannot be generalized easily to nonrigid types of motions, and even rotations in multiple shots can be a problem. Here, a method is presented that can handle general nonrigid motion models. A general matrix equation gives the corrupted image from the ideal object. Thus, inversion of this system allows us to get the ideal image from the corrupted one. This inversion is possible by efficient methods mixing Fourier transforms with the conjugate gradient method. A faster but empirical inversion is discussed as well as methods to determine the motion. Simulated three-dimensional affine data and two-dimensional pulsation data and in vivo nonrigid data are used for demonstration. All examples are multishot images where the object moves between shots. The results indicate that it is now possible to correct for nonrigid types of motion that are representative of many types of patient motion, although computation times remain an issue.},

A retrospective motion correction algorithm, Gradient-based motion correction, which significantly reduces ghosting and blurring artifacts due to subject motion was proposed. The technique uses the raw data of standard imaging sequences; no sequence modifications or additional equipment such as tracking devices are required. Rigid motion is assumed. METHODS: The approach iteratively searches for the motion trajectory yielding the sharpest image as measured by the entropy of spatial gradients. The vast space of motion parameters is efficiently explored by gradient-based optimization with a convergence guarantee. RESULTS: The method has been evaluated on both synthetic and real data in two and three dimensions using standard imaging techniques. MR images are consistently improved over different kinds of motion trajectories. Using a graphics processing unit implementation, computation times are in the order of a few minutes for a full three-dimensional volume. CONCLUSION: The presented technique can be an alternative or a complement to prospective motion correction methods and is able to improve images with strong motion artifacts from standard imaging sequences without requiring additional data.},

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain is often degraded by bulk head motion. Algorithms that address this by retrospective re-registration of images in an fMRI time series are all fundamentally limited by any motion that occurs through-plane. Here, a technique is described that can account for such motion by prospective correction in real time. A navigator echo is used before every image acquisition to detect superior/inferior displacements of the head. The displacement information is then used to adjust the plane of excitation of the ensuing single-shot echo-planar fMRI axial image. These correction updates can be completed in 100 mm with motion sensitivity at least as small as 0.5 mm. The efficacy of this method is documented in phantom and human studies.},

	abstract = {Global head motion occurring between successive image acquisitions during a functional MRI time series can corrupt the signal of physiologic brain activation, potentially invalidating interpretation of the final activation map from that particular fMRI time series. By approximating the head as a rigid body, multiaxial global head motion can be decomposed into orthogonal linear and rotational components. This paper describes a method using orbital navigator echoes to provide prospective correction for both through-plane and in-plane inter-image head rotation in functional MRI. The dynamic detection and correction of rotation can be performed in {\textless}100 ms. Phantom experiments demonstrate accurate correction of rotational motion over a range of +/-0.36 degrees to +/-12 degrees. Imaging studies in volunteers document the feasibility of real-time prospective correction of rotational motion in vivo. Using a modified receiver operating characteristic method, motion-corrected functional MRI sensorimotor studies incorporating deliberate head rotations are shown to be superior to functional MRI time series acquired under similar conditions but without motion correction.},

	abstract = {An MR-based method for tracking subject motion is presented. The technique identifies subject motion from the three-dimensional positions of three small samples attached to the subject in a fixed, triangular configuration. The updated positions of these samples relative to their initial positions determine a rigid body transformation. Applied to the MRI scan prescription via adaptive feedback controls, this transformation yields an updated MRI scan plane that tracks the prescribed imaging section as the subject moves. The scan-plane tracking procedure is demonstrated experimentally for two-dimensional imaging of a standard imaging phantom and the head of a human subject. Sets of images were acquired sequentially, with motion (translations and/or rotations) introduced between image frames. The scan-plane tracking system provides well registered image slices of the same section, adaptively compensating for the subject motion.},

This paper describes a novel technique called Prospective Acquisition CorrEction (PACE) for reducing motion-induced effects on magnetization history. Full three-dimensional rigid body estimation of head movement is obtained by image-based motion detection to a high level of accuracy. Adjustment of slice position and orientation, as well as regridding of residual volume to volume motion, is performed in real-time during data acquisition. Phantom experiments demonstrate a high level of consistency (translation {\textless} 40 microm; rotation {\textless} 0.05 degrees ) for detected motion parameters. In vivo experiments were carried out and they showed a significant decrease of variance between successively acquired datasets compared to retrospective correction algorithms.},

	abstract = {Despite the existence of numerous motion correction methods, head motion during MRI continues to be a major source of artifacts and can greatly reduce image quality. This applies particularly to diffusion weighted imaging, where strong gradients are applied during long encoding periods. These are necessary to encode microscopic movements. However, they also make the technique highly sensitive to bulk motion. In this work, we present a prospective motion correction method where all applied gradients are adjusted continuously to compensate for changes of the object position and ensure the desired phase evolution in the image coordinate frame. Additionally, in phantom experiments this new technique is used to reproduce motion artifacts with high accuracy by changing the position of the imaging frame relative to the measured object. In vivo measurements demonstrate the validity of the new correction method.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One potential barrier for using prospective motion correction (PMC) in the clinic is the unpredictable nature of a scan because of the direct interference with the imaging sequence. We demonstrate that a second set of "de-corrected" images can be reconstructed from a scan with PMC that show how images would have appeared without PMC enabled.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nTHEORY AND METHODS: For three-dimensional scans, the effects of PMC can be undone by performing a retrospective reconstruction based on the inverse of the transformation matrix used for real time gradient feedback. Retrospective reconstruction is performed using a generalized SENSE approach with continuous head motion monitored using a single-marker optical camera system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Reverse retrospective reconstruction is demonstrated for phantom and in vivo scans using an magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence including parallel and Partial Fourier acceleration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Reverse retrospective reconstruction can almost perfectly undo the effects of prospective feedback, and thereby provide a second image data set with the effects of motion correction removed. In case of correct feedback, one can directly compare the quality of the corrected with that of the uncorrected scan. Additionally, because erroneous feedback during PMC may introduce artifacts, it is possible to eliminate artifacts in a corrupted scan by reversing the false gradient updates.
