abstract = {Subject motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been problematic since its introduction as a clinical imaging modality. While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a ``toolbox{\{}''{\}} of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations.},

abstract = {Purpose To assess the prevalence, severity, and cost estimates associated with motion artifacts identified on clinical MR examinations, with a focus on the neuroaxis. Methods A retrospective review of 1 randomly selected full calendar week of MR examinations (April 2014) was conducted for the detection of significant motion artifacts in examinations performed at a single institution on 3 different MR scanners. A base-case cost estimate was computed from recently available institutional data, and correlated with sequence time and severity of motion artifacts. Results A total of 192 completed clinical examinations were reviewed. Significant motion artifacts were identified on sequences in 7.5{\%} of outpatient and 29.4{\%} of inpatient and/or emergency department MR examinations. The prevalence of repeat sequences was 19.8{\%} of total MRI examinations. The base-case cost estimate yielded a potential cost to the hospital of {\$}592 per hour in lost revenue due to motion artifacts. Potential institutional average costs borne (revenue forgone) of approximately {\$}115,000 per scanner per year may affect hospitals, owing to motion artifacts (univariate sensitivity analysis suggested a lower bound of {\$}92,600, and an upper bound of {\$}139,000). Conclusions Motion artifacts represent a frequent cause of MR image degradation, particularly for inpatient and emergency department patients, resulting in substantial costs to the radiology department. Greater attention and resources should be directed toward providing practical solutions to this dilemma.},

abstract = {Imaging biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are used to quantify normal development, disease, and the effects of disease-modifying therapies. However, motion during image acquisition introduces image artifacts that, in turn, affect derived markers. A systematic effect can be problematic since factors of interest like age, disease, and treatment are often correlated with both a structural change and the amount of head motion in the scanner, confounding the ability to distinguish biology from artifact. Here we evaluate the effect of head motion during image acquisition on morphometric estimates of structures in the human brain using several popular image analysis software packages (FreeSurfer 5.3, VBM8 SPM, and FSL Siena 5.0.7). Within-session repeated T1-weighted MRIs were collected on 12 healthy volunteers while performing different motion tasks, including two still scans. We show that volume and thickness estimates of the cortical gray matter are biased by head motion with an average apparent volume loss of roughly 0.7{\%}/mm/min of subject motion. Effects vary across regions and remain significant after excluding scans that fail a rigorous quality check. In view of these results, the interpretation of reported morphometric effects of movement disorders or other conditions with increased motion tendency may need to be revisited: effects may be overestimated when not controlling for head motion. Furthermore, drug studies with hypnotic, sedative, tranquilizing, or neuromuscular-blocking substances may contain spurious "effects" of reduced atrophy or brain growth simply because they affect motion distinct from true effects of the disease or therapeutic process.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Prospective motion correction for MRI and other imaging modalities are commonly based on the assumption of affine motion, i.e., rotations, shearing, scaling and translations. In addition it often involves transformations between different reference frames, especially for applications with an external tracking device. The goal of this work is to develop a computational framework for motion correction based on homogeneous transforms. Theory and Methods: The homogeneous representation of affine transformations uses 4 $\backslash$times 4 transformation matrices applied to four-dimensional augmented vectors. It is demonstrated how homogenous transforms can be used to describe the motion of slice objects during an MRI scan. Furthermore, we extend the concept of homogeneous transforms to gradient and k-space vectors, and show that the fourth dimension of an augmented k-space vector encodes the complex phase of the corresponding signal sample due to translations. Results: The validity of describing motion tracking in real space and k-space using homogeneous transformations only is demonstrated on phantom experiments. Conclusion: Homogeneous transformations allows for a conceptually simple, consistent and computationally efficient theoretical framework for motion correction applications.

	abstract = {Image processing was used as a fundamental tool to derive motion information from magnetic resonance (MR) images, which was fed back into prospective respiratory motion correction during subsequent data acquisition to improve image quality in coronary MR angiography (CMRA) scans. This reduces motion artifacts in the images and, in addition, enables the usage of a broader gating window than commonly used today to increase the scan efficiency. The aim of the study reported in this paper was to find a suitable motion model to be used for respiratory motion correction in cardiac imaging and to develop a calibration procedure to adapt the motion model to the individual patient. At first, the performance of three motion models [one-dimensional translation in feet-head (FH) direction, three-dimensional (3-D) translation, and 3-D affine transformation] was tested in a small volunteer study. An elastic image registration algorithm was applied to 3-D MR images of the coronary vessels obtained at different respiratory levels. A strong intersubject variability was observed. The 3-D translation and affine transformation model were found to be superior over the conventional FH translation model used today. Furthermore, a new approach is presented, which utilizes a fast model-based image registration to extract motion information from time series of low-resolution 3-D MR images, which reflects the respiratory motion of the heart. The registration is based on a selectable global 3-D motion model (translation, rigid, or affine transformation). All 3-D MR images were registered with respect to end expiration. The resulting time series of model parameters were analyzed in combination with additionally acquired motion information from a diaphragmatic MR pencil-beam navigator to calibrate the respiratory motion model. To demonstrate the potential of a calibrated motion model for prospective motion correction in coronary imaging, the approach was tested in CMRA examinations in five volunteers.},

An approach is presented that models, and removes, movement-related artifacts from fMRI time-series. This approach is predicated on the observation that movement-related effects are extant even after perfect realignment. Movement-related effects can be divided into those that are a function of position of the object in the frame of reference of the scanner and those that are due to movement in previous scans. This second component depends on the history of excitation experienced by spins in a small volume and consequent differences in local saturation. The spin excitation history thus will itself be a function of previous positions, suggesting an autoregression-moving average model for the effects of previous displacements on the current signal. A model is described as well as the adjustments for movement-related components that ensue. The empirical analyses suggest that (in extreme situations) over 90{\%} of fMRI signal can be attributed to movement, and that this artifactual component can be successfully removed.},

The algorithm determines the steady-state distribution of all voxels in a given slice and indicates which voxels need a spin-history correction. The spin-history correction is meant to be applied before standard realignment procedures. To obtain experimental data a special phantom and an MRI compatible motion system were designed. The effect of motion on spin-history is presented for data obtained using this phantom inside a 1.5-T MRI scanner. We show that the presented algorithm is capable of detecting the occurrence of a displacement, and it determines which voxels need a spin-history correction.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Robust motion correction is necessary to minimize respiratory motion artefacts in coronary MR angiography (CMRA). The state-of-the-art method uses a 1D feet-head translational motion correction approach, and data acquisition is limited to a small window in the respiratory cycle, which prolongs the scan by a factor of 2-3. The purpose of this work was to implement 3D affine motion correction for Cartesian whole-heart CMRA using a 3D navigator (3D-NAV) to allow for data acquisition throughout the whole respiratory cycle. METHODS: 3D affine transformations for different respiratory states (bins) were estimated by using 3D-NAV image acquisitions which were acquired during the startup profiles of a steady-state free precession sequence. The calculated 3D affine transformations were applied to the corresponding high-resolution Cartesian image acquisition which had been similarly binned, to correct for respiratory motion between bins. RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed no statistical difference between images acquired with the proposed method and the reference method using a diaphragmatic navigator with a narrow gating window. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that 3D-NAV and 3D affine correction can be used to acquire Cartesian whole-heart 3D coronary artery images with 100{\%} scan efficiency with similar image quality as with the state-of-the-art gated and corrected method with approximately 50{\%} scan efficiency.

The best 3D trajectory depends on tolerable scan time, readout time, geometric flexibility, flow/motion properties and others. A formalism for flow/motion sensitivity comparison based on the velocity k-space behavior is presented. It consists in finding the velocity k-space position as a function of the spatial k-space position. The trajectories are compared graphically by their velocity k-space maps, with simulations and with an objective computed index. The flow/motion properties of various 3D trajectories (cones, spiral-pr hybrid, spherical stack of spirals, 3DFT, 3D echo-planar, and shells) were determined. In terms of flow/motion sensitivity the cones trajectory is the best, however, it is difficult to use it for anisotropic resolutions or fields of view. Tolerating more flow sensitivity, the stack of spirals trajectory offers more geometric flexibility.},

A set of algorithms that can reverse the effects of object displacements and phase shifts was used. These algorithms essentially transfer the frame of reference of the image reconstruction from the static frame of the imager couch to the moving "visceral frame." An accurate record of tissue motion during image acquisition is required. To achieve this, the authors used specially encoded "navigator" echoes that are interleaved with the imaging sequence. Postprocessing of the navigator echo data provides a highly detailed record of the displacements and phase shifts that occur during imaging. Phantom studies demonstrated that the technique can directly correct image degradation caused by motion. In contrast to conventional artifact reduction techniques, such as ordered phase encoding and gradient moment nulling, this new method has a unique capacity to reduce motion unsharpness. Preliminary in vivo studies have demonstrated that the technique can markedly improve images degraded by voluntary motion and shows promise for addressing the problem of respiratory motion in thoracoabdominal imaging.},

MRI pulse sequences were developed to study k-space sampling strategies on such a shell. Data collected with a computer-controlled motion phantom with known rotational and translational motions were used to evaluate the technique. The accuracy and precision of the technique depend on the sampling density. Roughly 2000 sample points were necessary for accurate detection to within the error limits of the motion phantom when using a prototype time-intensive sampling method. This number of samples can be captured in an approximately 27-ms double excitation SNAV pulse sequence with a 3D helical spiral trajectory. Preliminary results with the helical SNAV are encouraging and indicate that accurate motion measurement suitable for retrospective or prospective correction should be feasible with SNAV echoes.},

Methods The pre-rotated, template matching SNAV method (preRot-SNAV) was developed in combination with a novel hybrid baseline strategy, which includes acquired and interpolated templates. Specifically, the SNAV templates are only rotated around X- and Y-axis; for each rotated SNAV, simulated baseline templates that mimic object rotation about the Z-axis were interpolated. The new method was first evaluated with phantom experiments. Then, a customized SNAV-interleaved gradient echo sequence was used to image three volunteers performing directed head motion. The SNAV motion measurements were used to retrospectively correct the brain images. Experiments were performed using a 3.0??T whole-body MRI scanner and both single and 8-channel head coils. Results Phantom rotations and translations measured using the hybrid baselines agreed to within 0.9?? and 1??mm compared to those measured with the original preRot-SNAV method. Retrospective motion correction of in vivo images using the hybrid preRot-SNAV effectively corrected for head rotation up to 4?? and 4??mm. Conclusions The presented hybrid approach enables the acquisition of pre-rotated baseline templates in as little as 2.5??s, and results in accurate measurement of rotations and translations.

The quality of the high-resolution structural data used for morphometric analysis is especially compromised by subject movement because high-resolution scans are of longer duration. A method is presented that measures and corrects rigid body motion and associated first-order shim changes in real time, using a pulse sequence with embedded cloverleaf navigators and a feedback control mechanism. The procedure requires a 12-s preliminary mapping scan. A single-path, 4.2-ms cloverleaf navigator is inserted every repetition time (TR) after the readout of a 3D fast low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence, requiring no additional RF pulses and minimally impacting scan duration. Every TR, a rigid body motion estimate is made and a correction is fed back to adjust the gradients and shim offsets. Images are corrected and reconstructed on the scanner computer for immediate access. Correction for between-scan motion can be accomplished by using the same reference map for each scan repetition. Human and phantom tests demonstrated a consistent improvement in image quality if motion occurred during the acquisition.},

	abstract = {Artifacts caused by patient motion during scanning remain a serious problem in most MRI applications. The prospective motion correction technique attempts to address this problem at its source by keeping the measurement coordinate system fixed with respect to the patient throughout the entire scan process. In this study, a new image-based approach for prospective motion correction is described, which utilizes three orthogonal two-dimensional spiral navigator acquisitions, along with a flexible image-based tracking method based on the extended Kalman filter algorithm for online motion measurement. The spiral navigator/extended Kalman filter framework offers the advantages of image-domain tracking within patient-specific regions-of-interest and reduced sensitivity to off-resonance-induced corruption of rigid-body motion estimates. The performance of the method was tested using offline computer simulations and online in vivo head motion experiments. In vivo validation results covering a broad range of staged head motions indicate a steady-state error of less than 10{\%} of the motion magnitude, even for large compound motions that included rotations over 15 deg. A preliminary in vivo application in three-dimensional inversion recovery spoiled gradient echo (IR-SPGR) and three-dimensional fast spin echo (FSE) sequences demonstrates the effectiveness of the spiral navigator/extended Kalman filter framework for correcting three-dimensional rigid-body head motion artifacts prospectively in high-resolution three-dimensional MRI scans.},

This time fits well into the existing gaps in sequences routinely used for neuroimaging, thus giving a motion-corrected sequence with no extra time required. We also demonstrate motion-driven selective reacquisition of k-space to further compensate for subject motion. We perform multiple validation experiments to evaluate accuracy, navigator impact on tissue intensity/contrast, and the improvement in final output. The complete system operates without adding additional hardware to the scanner and requires no external calibration, making it suitable for high-throughput environments.},
