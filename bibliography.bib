abstract = {Artifacts due to periodic motion during the acquisition of magnetic resonance (MR) images have been studied. A mechanical device was constructed to oscillate a small sample along any line within a 0.15-T Technicare imager. Two- and three-dimensional images were obtained using various frequencies and amplitudes of oscillation. Computer simulations of these experiments yielded images which agreed with the experiments. We demonstrated that movement influences MR images locally through blurring, and also generates ghost artifacts along the phase-encoding directions of the Fourier transform imaging technique.},

abstract = {Subject motion during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been problematic since its introduction as a clinical imaging modality. While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a ``toolbox{\{}''{\}} of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations.},

@article{Andre2015,
abstract = {Purpose To assess the prevalence, severity, and cost estimates associated with motion artifacts identified on clinical MR examinations, with a focus on the neuroaxis. Methods A retrospective review of 1 randomly selected full calendar week of MR examinations (April 2014) was conducted for the detection of significant motion artifacts in examinations performed at a single institution on 3 different MR scanners. A base-case cost estimate was computed from recently available institutional data, and correlated with sequence time and severity of motion artifacts. Results A total of 192 completed clinical examinations were reviewed. Significant motion artifacts were identified on sequences in 7.5{\%} of outpatient and 29.4{\%} of inpatient and/or emergency department MR examinations. The prevalence of repeat sequences was 19.8{\%} of total MRI examinations. The base-case cost estimate yielded a potential cost to the hospital of {\$}592 per hour in lost revenue due to motion artifacts. Potential institutional average costs borne (revenue forgone) of approximately {\$}115,000 per scanner per year may affect hospitals, owing to motion artifacts (univariate sensitivity analysis suggested a lower bound of {\$}92,600, and an upper bound of {\$}139,000). Conclusions Motion artifacts represent a frequent cause of MR image degradation, particularly for inpatient and emergency department patients, resulting in substantial costs to the radiology department. Greater attention and resources should be directed toward providing practical solutions to this dilemma.},

Furthermore, to determine a possible influence of constructional differences between a 1.5 and a 0.5 tesla scanner on the frequency of MA. Two hundred and ninety-seven first time MRI patients were surveyed before and after imaging with anxiety and attitude questionnaires. Frequency and impact on diagnostic quality of MA were documented. 12.8{\%} of all scans showed MA not related to normal body pulsations. In 6.4{\%} the diagnostic quality was impaired. Constructional differences did not influence the frequency of MA. Also, anxiety as determined with the most common anxiety measuring instrument was not related to the development of MA. Concern about the technical apparatus identified 70.6{\%} of all individuals developing MA. Patients at risk for the development of MA can be identified prior to scanning. It seems necessary to further develop reliable methods to detect them and to evaluate strategies to prevent MA.},

abstract = {Imaging biomarkers derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data are used to quantify normal development, disease, and the effects of disease-modifying therapies. However, motion during image acquisition introduces image artifacts that, in turn, affect derived markers. A systematic effect can be problematic since factors of interest like age, disease, and treatment are often correlated with both a structural change and the amount of head motion in the scanner, confounding the ability to distinguish biology from artifact. Here we evaluate the effect of head motion during image acquisition on morphometric estimates of structures in the human brain using several popular image analysis software packages (FreeSurfer 5.3, VBM8 SPM, and FSL Siena 5.0.7). Within-session repeated T1-weighted MRIs were collected on 12 healthy volunteers while performing different motion tasks, including two still scans. We show that volume and thickness estimates of the cortical gray matter are biased by head motion with an average apparent volume loss of roughly 0.7{\%}/mm/min of subject motion. Effects vary across regions and remain significant after excluding scans that fail a rigorous quality check. In view of these results, the interpretation of reported morphometric effects of movement disorders or other conditions with increased motion tendency may need to be revisited: effects may be overestimated when not controlling for head motion. Furthermore, drug studies with hypnotic, sedative, tranquilizing, or neuromuscular-blocking substances may contain spurious "effects" of reduced atrophy or brain growth simply because they affect motion distinct from true effects of the disease or therapeutic process.},
